# Gangs and Displacement in Haiti
 Displacement in Port-au-Prince

## Find my page here. __URL__

I sought to analyze the data from the International Organization for Migration's assesment of the displacement caused by insecurity and gangs in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince. The angles I sought to explore are as follows:
- The number of IDPs / IDPs per commune/neighborhood (hbars)
- Where did the IDPs come from? When?
- Site types (spontaneous or host communities) (donut)
- Who owns the land of the sites (non host communities)?
- Average people per sq meter at sites
- How many people over 60? Under 18?
- How many sites are inaccessible?
- Is there tension between the host community and the IDPs?
- What assistance has been received? Food? Health? Cash? Education?
- Do the IDPs have identification?
- Cholera deaths. Fear of cholera vaccine.

Findings: __________

Data collection methods:
- IOM included data from 459 IDP sites and host communities during their visit in February and March 2023; however, 172 of these entries had very little to no data, so I removed them from my analysis. This left 287 sites to analyze.
- 

Skills I learned:
- I learned how to auto-translate cells in Google Sheets, which I used to translate the original data from French to English.
- 

If I had more time, _______________.
